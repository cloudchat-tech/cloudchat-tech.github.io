# We Can Hardly Contain Ourselves!

## Summary

In today's episode, Carl and Brandon dive deep into container technology. They
cover everything from the container file to orchestrating containers on a cloud
platform. Furthermore, Carl and Brandon discuss how Docker is not the
end-all-be-all of container technology, and options that you have to use instead
of Docker. If you want to learn more about what containers are, how they work,
why you would want to use them, and how they apply to more than just the cloud,
this is the episode for you!
