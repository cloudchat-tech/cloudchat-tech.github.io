  Performance in cloud architecture isn’t just about raw speed—it's about
  choosing the right resources, scaling with intent, and constantly tuning for
  change. In this episode, we walk through the Performance Efficiency pillar of
  the Azure Well-Architected Framework and compare how AWS and GCP approach the
  same challenges.

# Turbocharged: Mastering Performance in Cloud Architecture

## Summary

Cloud performance is one of those words that everyone agrees matters, but often
means different things depending on who you ask. Is it latency? Is it
autoscaling? Is it picking the right SKU size?

We cover the fundamentals of designing for performance in the cloud: how to
select the right compute options, when to scale up or out, and what it takes to
reduce latency across global workloads. We explore autoscaling strategies,
observability tooling, cost tradeoffs, and real-world tuning stories—plus we
wrap with a cheat sheet of optimization tools across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Performance isn’t just about throwing more cores or RAM at a problem. It’s a set
of design choices you make continuously—choices that affect cost, scalability,
and user experience. Use the principles and tools in your cloud provider to
experiment, monitor, and improve.
