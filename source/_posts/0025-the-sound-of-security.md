summary:
  Security in the cloud is built on identity, infrastructure, data, monitoring,
  and governance. Each major provider has its own approach, but the fundamentals
  converge around least privilege, encryption, and shared responsibility.

# The Sound of Security

## Summary

Security is more than a feature, it’s a pillar of the Well-Architected
Framework. In this episode, Carl and Brandon explore how AWS, Azure, and GCP
approach security across identity and access, infrastructure defense, data
protection, monitoring, governance, and the shared responsibility model.

They compare tools and practices like IAM, RBAC, and conditional access; network
firewalls, WAFs, and DDoS protection; encryption at rest and in transit; and
incident detection and automated remediation. The conversation also dives into
security testing, drift detection with IaC, compliance posture, and how policy
enforcement differs across the big three. The episode closes with a reminder
that cloud security is always shared, and is never finished.
