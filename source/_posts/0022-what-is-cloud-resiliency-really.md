summary:
  Carl and Brandon take a grounded look at what cloud resiliency really means —
  and how it compares to availability, reliability, and redundancy. They unpack
  strategies for designing systems that recover gracefully from failure, using
  real-world examples and architectural patterns that keep your cloud stack
  steady when it matters most.

# What is Cloud Resiliency, Really?

## Summary

Carl and Brandon break down the core concepts behind cloud resiliency,
availability, reliability, and redundancy — how they relate, where they differ,
and why understanding those distinctions is critical. Just because a service is
“always on” doesn’t mean it’s resilient. They explore the difference between
planned and unplanned outages, how graceful degradation works in practice, and
why resiliency is measured by recovery, not just uptime.

> It’s not just about uptime. It’s about what breaks, how you recover, and what
> keeps going when everything else doesn’t.

They also cover the architectural side: distributed systems, zone-aware
deployments, chaos testing, and recovery strategies that go beyond
documentation. With real-world failure scenarios and practical planning advice,
this episode helps cloud teams build for failure — before it happens.
