# Are Your Cloud Costs Too Damn High???

## Summary

Cloud cost optimization is about designing systems that perform efficiently
without wasting money. In this episode, Carl and Brandon break down how AWS,
Azure, and Google Cloud help teams rightsize compute, manage storage tiers, and
control networking costs. They talk through savings plans, spot instances,
lifecycle management, and data transfer strategies that keep performance high
and waste low.

The discussion then moves into monitoring, automation, and FinOps culture, where
budgets, policies, and shared accountability make optimization stick. They cover
dashboards, tagging, auto-shutdown routines, and partner-led programs that
unlock funding and deeper discounts. Real-world stories from enterprises and
startups highlight one key truth: cost management is not a cleanup exercise, it
is an ongoing habit that keeps cloud architectures both efficient and
sustainable.
